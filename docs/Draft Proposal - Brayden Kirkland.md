## Draft Proposal
# Problem Statement:
	People should act more rationally and think more logically when looking at problems that can be solved, and this can be taught through the unassuming medium of a video game. Nearly everyday, I see the consequences of illogical, irrational decisions made by people who, in this day and age, should know better. Today is the age of information, yet more and more, I observe people who seem unable to connect the dots. The lines of thinking that these people follow are outright dangerous, easily leading down the path of extremism and paranoia, unable to see a bigger picture but the box they’ve decided to lock themselves in.

	I want to change this, no matter how small that change may be. I want to make people see the world in a different light; to be more open, reasonable, to think logically, and I want to entertain. This is the world that I want people to live in: a world centered around compassion for one another, a world full of sympathetic people who care and listen. The world would be a kinder place, full of empathy, compassion, and understanding.

	My solution to this, despite how small and temporary it may be, is a video game. A game designed to push the boundaries of logical thinking not just through game mechanics, but also an enthralling, compelling story to drive people toward better thinking. Not all art needs to have a purpose, but I want mine to be useful to people.


## Puzzle Heart Test Plan:
# 1.  Purpose and Objectives 
	Purpose — The purpose of the Puzzle Heart video game study is to evaluate the problem solving skills required to complete the 	game, with every playthrough being timed. Test operators will be instructed to the complete the game to the best of their ability 	and as fast as they can. Test operators will also be given a short survey to complete after their experience for feedback 	purposes.

Objectives — Objectives for the activity are:   

1.	To identify the average time it takes to complete the game. 

2.	To receive feedback on the entertainment value of the game.

3.	To receive feedback on the difficulty level of the game.

4.	To receive feedback on what test users think could be different about the game.


# 2.  Test Procedure 
	Summary of procedure — The plan for conducting the Puzzle Heart video game study and collecting data is to have test participants 	play the Puzzle Heart video game to its completion, to the best of their ability, and to then provide feedback on their 	experience. These testing playthroughs will be timed and recorded to properly document the running of the game.

	Place and time — Each participant will use same device to play the game individually. The testing sessions will be held in Room 	203 in Ashby Hall. Participants will be given thirty minutes to complete the game.


# 3.  Participants
	Test participants — Any willing volunteer to participate in testing is welcome, and do not require any prior skills or experience. 	The only characteristics ideal for testing are as follows:

	- Normal or corrected-to-normal color vision. 

	- Normal dexterity with at least one hand, either right or left, adequate for using a mouse cursor positioning device. 

	- No specific gender or age requirement. 

	- Willingness to openly grant feedback on their experience and what they think could be changed.


# 4. Site
	Requirements for facility -- The site for the Puzzle Heart video game study will be the lab in Room 203 of Ashby Hall. This 	location will be equipped with one or more testing devices. Each of these testing devices will be running either Windows 10 or 11, 	and have installed on it the Puzzle Heart video game software.


# 5. Experimental Design
	The design of the experiment is a within subjects design.

	Independent variable -- We will categorize the participants according to the following independent variable:
	- The random nature of the Puzzle Heart video game.

	Dependent variable -- Quantitative performance measure for the testing will include the following:
	- Time it takes for each participant to complete the game.


# 6. Resources and Preparation
	Equipment -- Equipment needed for the test includes:
	- Windows 10 or 11 running machine.
	- Aforementioned machine installed with Puzzle Heart video game software
	- Timer


# 7. Data Collection
	Sources of data -- The source of data for Puzzle Heart test data collection are:
	- Participants' time taken to play game to completion.
	- Participants' feedback post-test.

	Data topics -- The data collection topics will include:
	- Participants' feedback.
	- Time to play demo through completion.

# 8. Data Analysis
	Purpose -- The purpose of data analysis is to determine the average time it takes multiple test users to complete the Puzzle Heart 	video game, and to gather their thoughts on the experience itself.

	Activities -- Data analysis activities are:
	- Capture time it takes for each participant to complete the game demo.
	- Gather feedback from each participant about their experience.


# 9. Deliverables
	The following products of the Puzzle Heart video game study will be delivered:
	- Time data for each participant.
	- A record on each participant's given feedback.
