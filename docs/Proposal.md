Proposal
========

Student Name:
-------------
Brayden Kirkland.

Degree and Major:
-----------------
Bachelor of the Arts; Applied Computing with a focus on Cybersecurity.

Project Advisor Name:
---------------------
Dr. Sean Hayes.

Expected Graduation Date:
-------------------------
May, 2026.

Problem Statement:
------------------

People should act more rationally and think more logically when looking at
problems that can be solved, and this can be taught through the unassuming
medium of a video game. Nearly every day, I see the consequences of people
making illogical, irrational decisions made by people who should know better.

I want to make people see the world in a different light; to be more open, andÂ reasonable, to think logically, and I want to entertain. Through this mode
of thinking, the world would be a kinder place, full of empathy, compassion, and understanding, and this is ideal state of affairs.

My solution to this problem is the developmnt of a video game. My intention with this solution is to change the minds of those who experience it to solve the problem discussed above. 

Project Description:
--------------------
For my senior project, I intend to create a video game I call Puzzle Heart. This
game will be designed to challenge a player's intuition, awareness, and problem
solving skills within a story-rich and atmospheric environment of my design. It
will consist of the player traveling through several sections of a labyrinth
while solving various puzzles along the way, though with an added randomness to
every playthrough that I will be making a custom algorithm for.

Proposed Implementation Language(s):
------------------------------------
I intend to implement this project game using the C++ coding language

Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used:
-------------------------------------------------------
Unreal Engine 5's built in libraries, packages, and
development kits. This software will allow me to utilize pre-made and custom
assets to build the game world.

Additional Software/Equipment Needed:
-------------------------------------
The Unreal Engine 5 video game development software.

Personal Motivation:
--------------------
My motivation for the construction of this project is my love of video games,
designing intricate worlds, and writing. I intend for the process of creating
this project to further my own knowledge in the field of computing, and to also
serve as an inspiration for others who wish to tell stories through video games.

Outline of Future Research Efforts:
-----------------------------------
I will be completing this project myself using the Unreal Engine 5 software,
learning its intricacies and tricks as I go. To be expected from this project is
a fully-functioning, fleshed out, short video game rich with story, atmospheric
visuals, and challenging puzzles.

Schedule:
---------
A very rough, short schedule I have in mind is that a functioning demo will be complete
by the end of this semester.
